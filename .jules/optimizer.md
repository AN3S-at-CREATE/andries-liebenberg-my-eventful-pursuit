# OPTIMIZER'S JOURNAL - CRITICAL LEARNINGS ONLY

## 2025-02-19 - Route-based Code Splitting
   **Bottleneck:** All page components were statically imported in `App.tsx`, causing the entire application code to be bundled into a single large file (or few large chunks) loaded on initial visit.
   **Learning:** Modern bundlers like Vite support dynamic imports (`import()`) which, when combined with `React.lazy`, allow splitting code into separate chunks that are loaded on demand.
   **Prevention:** Always use `React.lazy` for route components to ensure the initial bundle size remains minimal and pages are loaded only when accessed.

## 2025-05-24 - Canvas Particle Rendering
   **Bottleneck:** The `ParallaxStarfield` component was using `ctx.arc()` (which constructs a path) for thousands of stars every frame, creating significant CPU overhead even for tiny 1px dots.
   **Learning:** `ctx.fillRect()` is significantly faster than `ctx.arc()` for small shapes because it skips the path construction step. For particles smaller than 1.5px, the visual difference between a square and a circle is negligible.
   **Prevention:** When building particle systems on Canvas, prefer `fillRect` for small particles (< 2px) to reduce draw call overhead.

## 2025-10-24 - Unoptimized Image Tags
   **Bottleneck:** Missing explicit `width` and `height` attributes on `<img>` tags, leading to Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and missing `loading="lazy"` on below-the-fold images causing unnecessary early network requests.
   **Learning:** Browsers cannot reserve space for images without explicit dimensions, which causes layout shifts as the image loads. Deferring off-screen image loading with `loading="lazy"` speeds up initial page load and saves bandwidth.
   **Prevention:** Always declare `width` and `height` attributes on all `<img>` tags (matching their CSS aspect ratio) and apply `loading="lazy"` for below-the-fold images. Use `decoding="async"` for non-critical images to avoid blocking the main thread.

## 2024-05-18 - Disable global cursor glow on mobile devices
**Bottleneck:** The `GlobalCursorGlow` component was rendering background particle DIVs and continuously tracking `mousemove` events on mobile devices.
**Learning:** Touch devices do not have a cursor. Thus, registering event listeners and performing frame-by-frame JS rendering updates for framer-motion DOM elements on a touch screen purely wastes battery and JS main thread budget, causing microstutters.
**Prevention:** Always verify if a dynamic visual effect, like a custom cursor, is applicable on the user's input modality. Utilize device-detection hooks like `useIsMobile()` to short-circuit processing on touch interfaces and conditionally return `null` before executing layout or rendering trees.
